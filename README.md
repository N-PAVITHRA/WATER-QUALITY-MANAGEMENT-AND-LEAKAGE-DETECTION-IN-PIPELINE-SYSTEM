# WATER-QUALITY-MANAGEMENT-AND-LEAKAGE-DETECTION-IN-PIPELINE-SYSTEM
This project aims to create a simple and efficient method of water leakage detection and quality management in pipeline systems.
The quality management system encompasses of checking the pH, turbidity, temperature.
Leakage detection is done using a water flow sensor.
